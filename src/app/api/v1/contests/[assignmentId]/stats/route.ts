/**
 * Contest Stats Endpoint
 *
 * GET /api/v1/contests/:assignmentId/stats
 *
 * Returns aggregate statistics for a contest assignment:
 * - participantCount: total enrolled students
 * - submittedCount: students with at least one terminal submission
 * - avgScore: average total score among submitters (1 decimal)
 * - problemsSolvedCount: problems with at least one full-score submission
 *
 * Access control: same as the leaderboard endpoint.
 * - Instructors and admins: always allowed
 * - Recruiting candidates: only with instructor access
 * - Other users: must be enrolled or have a valid contest access token
 *
 * Rate limit: "leaderboard" tier
