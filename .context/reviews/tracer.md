# Tracer Review — RPF Cycle 8/100

**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Cycle:** 8/100
**Lens:** causal tracing of suspicious flows, competing hypotheses, control-flow analysis

---

## Cycle-7 carry-over verification

The cycle-7 doc-only fixes (SUNSET CRITERION comment, plan archival, route.ts:84 explanatory comment) introduced no executable code changes. All cycle-7 traced control-flow paths remain valid:

1. **Step 5b backfill causal chain** (cycle-6 critical): trigger → DB ready → Step 5b psql container → DO-block IF EXISTS guard → conditional UPDATE. No state change since cycle-7.
2. **`_lastRefreshFailureAt` mutation lifecycle** (TRC7-1): three mutation sites, dispose-coupling, TTL boundaries. No state change since cycle-7.
3. **Anti-cheat retry timer lifecycle** (TRC7-2): scheduleRetryRef closure, useEffect ordering. No state change since cycle-7.
4. **Proxy token-validation flow** (TRC7-3): cache key includes authenticatedAt. No state change since cycle-7.

## TRC8-1: [LOW, NEW] No new control-flow defects detected this cycle

**Severity:** LOW (verification — no findings)
**Confidence:** HIGH

**Evidence:** Re-traced all paths inspected in cycle-7. No defects. The cycle-7 doc-only commits cannot introduce control-flow changes.

**Fix:** No action — no findings.

## Summary

**Cycle-8 NEW findings:** 0 HIGH, 0 MEDIUM, 0 LOW.
**Cycle-7 carry-over status:** All cycle-7 traced control flows remain sound.
**Tracer verdict:** No control-flow defects at HEAD.
