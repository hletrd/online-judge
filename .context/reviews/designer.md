# Designer Review — RPF Cycle 8/100

**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Cycle:** 8/100
**Lens:** UI/UX, accessibility (WCAG 2.2), responsive, dark/light mode, perceived performance, i18n, focus/keyboard

**Runtime status:** No live runtime in sandbox per cycle-3 sandbox limitation (`src/instrumentation.ts` register hook requires live Postgres; no Docker available). Source-level fallback review.

## Cycle-7 carry-over verification

UI-relevant cycle-7 items reverified (none were plannable; all deferred):
- DES7-1 (privacy notice no decline path, carried from DES3-1) — still carried.
- DES7-2 (privacy notice WCAG AA contrast borderline) — still carried; needs runtime.
- DES7-3 (modal escape handler implicit) — still carried.
- DES7-4 (heartbeat interval hardcoded) — still carried.
- DES7-5 (smallest mobile dialog overflow) — still carried; needs runtime.

The cycle-7 commits (`809446dc`, `2aab3a33`, `ea083609`) are doc-only — no UI changes. No regressions to the privacy-notice surface or any other UI surface.

## DES8-1: [LOW, NEW] No new UI/UX findings this cycle

**Severity:** LOW (verification — no findings)
**Confidence:** HIGH

**Evidence:** Re-inspected `src/components/exam/anti-cheat-monitor.tsx` and supporting Dialog/Button/Toast components. No code changes since cycle-7. The anti-cheat privacy notice surface remains the primary deferred a11y area, with reasoning unchanged (UX/legal call carried since cycle 3).

**Note:** Live runtime review remains blocked per cycle-3 sandbox limitation. Once a runtime sandbox or staging environment becomes available, the deferred runtime-verification items (DES7-2, DES7-5) can be re-opened.

**Fix:** No action — no findings.

## Summary

**Cycle-8 NEW findings:** 0 HIGH, 0 MEDIUM, 0 LOW.
**Cycle-7 carry-over status:** All cycle-7 designer defers carried unchanged.
**Designer verdict:** No regressions at HEAD. The exam-only privacy notice surface remains the primary a11y deferred area. Runtime-required findings remain blocked by sandbox limitation.
