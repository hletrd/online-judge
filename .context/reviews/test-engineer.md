# Test Engineer Review — RPF Cycle 8/100

**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Cycle:** 8/100
**Lens:** test coverage gaps, test-determinism, flaky tests, TDD opportunities, regression coverage

---

## Cycle-7 carry-over verification

All cycle-7 plan tasks confirmed at HEAD; gates green:
- `npm run test:unit` — 304 test files, 2234 tests, 0 failures (verified at cycle-8 start, 31s).
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 14 unchanged warnings (untracked dev .mjs scripts).
- `npm run build` — exit 0.

Cycle-7 carried-deferred test items reverified:
- TE7-1 (hash semantics SQL-vs-JS not pinned) — still no test asserting equivalence. Carried.
- TE7-2 (success-path cooldown clearing lacks regression test) — still no dedicated test. Carried.
- TE7-3 (performFlush lacks dedicated unit test) — still no dedicated test. Carried.
- TE7-4 (schema-parity only generic) — still 4 generic tests. Carried.
- TE7-5 (no first-set delete-cooldown test) — still no test. Carried.

The cycle-7 doc-only commits (`809446dc`, `2aab3a33`, `ea083609`) did not change executable code, so test coverage is unchanged from cycle-7 baseline.

## TE8-1: [LOW, NEW] No new test coverage gaps this cycle

**Severity:** LOW (verification — no findings)
**Confidence:** HIGH

**Evidence:** No new code introduced. All 2234 tests pass deterministically. No flaky tests identified. The cycle-7 carried-deferred test items remain accurate.

**Fix:** No action — no findings.

## Summary

**Cycle-8 NEW findings:** 0 HIGH, 0 MEDIUM, 0 LOW.
**Cycle-7 carry-over status:** All cycle-7 test defers carried unchanged.
**Test verdict:** Test suite is healthy at HEAD (2234 passing). Cycle-8 introduced no test-coverage regressions.
