# Performance Reviewer — RPF Cycle 8/100

**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Cycle:** 8/100
**Lens:** performance, concurrency, memory, hot paths, GC, cache efficiency, deploy-time cost

---

## Cycle-7 carry-over verification

All cycle-7 plan tasks confirmed at HEAD; no performance regressions detected.

The cycle-7 doc-only commits (`809446dc`, `2aab3a33`, `ea083609`) introduced no executable code changes. Performance characteristics unchanged from cycle-7 baseline.

Specific re-verification:
- `_lastRefreshFailureAt` Map is bounded by `analyticsCache` capacity (LRU max=100) via dispose hook. ✓ No unbounded growth.
- `analyticsCache` LRU max=100, TTL=60s — sufficient for typical workloads.
- Rate-limiter cooldown is 5s — keeps thundering-herd attempts to ≤1 per 5s per cache key.
- Step 5b backfill runtime cost ~5-10s per deploy. SUNSET CRITERION (cycle-7 Task A) documents the path to remove this cost after retention period.

## PERF8-1: [LOW, NEW] No new performance findings this cycle

**Severity:** LOW (verification — no findings)
**Confidence:** HIGH

**Evidence:** Hot paths (analytics route, anti-cheat flush, proxy cache) re-inspected. No new perf issues. All cycle-7 carried-deferred perf items remain accurate:
- PERF7-1/CRIT7-1/CRIT7-2 (Step 5b backfill 5-10s per deploy) — RESOLVED via cycle-7 Task A SUNSET CRITERION comment (acknowledges the cost and provides removal path).
- PERF7-2 (drizzle-kit npm install per-deploy) — still carried.
- PERF7-3 (_lastRefreshFailureAt indirect bound) — still carried.
- PERF7-4 (performFlush serial-await) — still carried.
- PERF7-5 (proxy.ts authUserCache O(n) cleanup) — still carried.
- PERF7-6 (cache-miss getDbNowMs round-trip) — still carried.

**Fix:** No action — no findings.

## Summary

**Cycle-8 NEW findings:** 0 HIGH, 0 MEDIUM, 0 LOW.
**Cycle-7 carry-over status:** PERF7-1 resolved (SUNSET CRITERION); other defers carried.
**Performance verdict:** No hot-path performance issues at HEAD. Step 5b backfill cost is now documented with removal criteria.
