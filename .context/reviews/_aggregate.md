# RPF Cycle 2 (Loop Cycle 2/100) — Aggregate Review

**Date:** 2026-04-24
**Base commit:** fab30962 (cycle 1 multi-agent review — no new findings)
**HEAD commit:** fab30962
**Review artifacts:** code-reviewer, perf-reviewer, security-reviewer, architect, critic, verifier, debugger, test-engineer, tracer, designer (source-level fallback), document-specialist — 11 lanes.

## Deduped Findings (sorted by severity then signal)

**No new production-code findings this cycle.** All 11 review perspectives agree: no production source code has changed since cycle 1. The codebase is in a stable, mature state.

## Cross-Agent Agreement

All 11 reviewers confirm:
1. No new production-code findings this cycle.
2. All prior fixes from cycles 37-55 remain intact.
3. The codebase is in a stable, mature state.
4. The `SKIP_INSTRUMENTATION_SYNC` short-circuit is production-safe (strict-literal `"1"`, loud warning log, not present in `.env.deploy.algo` or `docker-compose.production.yml`).
5. Runtime UI/UX review remains sandbox-blocked pending a Docker-enabled sandbox or managed-Postgres sidecar.

## Carry-Over Deferred Items (unchanged from cycle 1 aggregate)

Total: **19+1 deferred items** — all carried forward. Unchanged list:

- **AGG-2 (cycle 45):** `atomicConsumeRateLimit` uses `Date.now()` in hot path — MEDIUM/MEDIUM, deferred.
- **AGG-2:** Leaderboard freeze uses `Date.now()` — LOW/LOW, deferred.
- **AGG-5:** `console.error` in client components — LOW/MEDIUM, deferred.
- **AGG-6:** SSE O(n) eviction scan — LOW/LOW, deferred.
- **AGG-7 / ARCH-2:** Manual routes duplicate `createApiHandler` boilerplate — MEDIUM/MEDIUM, deferred.
- **AGG-8:** Global timer HMR pattern duplication — LOW/MEDIUM, deferred.
- **AGG-3 (cycle 48):** Practice page unsafe type assertion — LOW/LOW, deferred.
- **SEC-2 (cycle 43):** Anti-cheat heartbeat dedup uses `Date.now()` for LRU cache — LOW/LOW, deferred.
- **SEC-3:** Anti-cheat copies user text content — LOW/LOW, deferred.
- **SEC-4:** Docker build error leaks paths — LOW/LOW, deferred.
- **PERF-3:** Anti-cheat heartbeat gap query transfers up to 5000 rows — MEDIUM/MEDIUM, deferred.
- **DES-1:** Chat widget button badge lacks ARIA announcement — LOW/LOW, deferred.
- **DES-1 (cycle 46):** Contests page badge hardcoded colors — LOW/LOW, deferred.
- **DES-1 (cycle 48):** Anti-cheat privacy notice accessibility — LOW/LOW, deferred.
- **DOC-1:** SSE route ADR — LOW/LOW, deferred.
- **DOC-2:** Docker client dual-path docs — LOW/LOW, deferred.
- **ARCH-3:** Stale-while-revalidate cache pattern duplication — LOW/LOW, deferred.
- **TE-1 (cycle 51):** Missing integration test for concurrent recruiting token redemption — LOW/MEDIUM, deferred (requires DB).
- **I18N-JA-ASPIRATIONAL (cycle 55):** `messages/ja.json` absent — LOW/LOW, deferred.
- **DES-RUNTIME-{1..5} (cycle 55):** blocked-by-sandbox runtime findings — severities LOW..HIGH-if-violated, deferred under documented exit criterion.

## Deferred Finding (Carried from Cycle 4)

- **#21: vitest unit parallel-contention flakes** — `tests/unit/api/submissions.route.test.ts:212-228` and other `it.each` parametrized API route tests. LOW/MEDIUM. Reason: sandbox CPU/IO contention under parallel vitest workers; tests pass cleanly in isolation (25/25 with `--no-file-parallelism`). Not a code bug. Exit criterion: tune `vitest.config.ts` pool, or run RPF loop in a higher-CPU sandbox.

## AGENT FAILURES

None. All 11 reviewer lanes completed and wrote artifacts.

## Verified Fixes From Prior Cycles (All Still Intact)

All fixes from cycles 37-55 remain intact. Spot-verified across multiple angles (code-quality, security, performance, debugger, test-engineer, architect).
