# Open Workstreams

Last updated: 2026-03-08

The `dashboard-rendering-audit-and-editor-upgrades` batch is now locally verified and its plan docs are reconciled. The items below remain open outside that completed batch.

## Recently closed locally

- Assignment-aware submission validation, the group-scoped assignment board, and scoped instructor submission drill-down
- Login-event logging plus the admin login-log dashboard/navigation surface
- Theme switching, CodeMirror code surfaces, markdown rendering, draft recovery, mixed submission IDs, and guarded delete flows

## Still open

- Assignment CRUD and group membership management
- Broader audit/event logging beyond credential login history
- Additional language/runtime expansion work
- CI and backup/observability work

## Safety note

- The demo host is still only confirmed at commit `6951d46`; do not describe the newer local dashboard/audit/editor upgrades as deployed until the next remote rollout is verified.
- Future sessions should isolate the next coherent batch before updating deployment-facing docs again.
