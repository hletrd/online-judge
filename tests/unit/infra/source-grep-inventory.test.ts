/**
 * Source-grep inventory
 *
 * "Source-grep tests" are unit tests that read source files with readFileSync
 * and assert on their text content rather than importing and exercising runtime
 * behaviour.  They are a legitimate contract-testing pattern for infra, schema,
 * and deployment artefacts, but should not become the default approach for
 * application logic where behavioural tests are more robust.
 *
 * This test acts as a change-detection gate: if the count shifts, the
 * committer must review whether a new source-grep test was intentional or
 * whether a behavioural test should have been written instead.

 * "infra/config"  — playwright, worker runtime, language inventory, pgdata
 * "implementation"— text-contract checks on source files that verify wiring
 *                   (e.g. capability checks, route guards, i18n keys).
