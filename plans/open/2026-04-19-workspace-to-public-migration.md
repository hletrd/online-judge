# Workspace-to-Public Page Migration Plan

**Date:** 2026-04-19
**Status:** Phase 1 COMPLETE, Phase 2 COMPLETE, Phase 3 COMPLETE, Phase 4 IN PROGRESS (cycle 19 — consolidated formatting utilities with locale-aware formatNumber/formatBytes, replaced .toFixed() in public pages, fixed clipboard error feedback; remaining: remove dashboard duplicate pages)
**Source:** User-injected TODO #2, AGG-13

## Goal

Deprecate the `(workspace)` route group and consolidate navigation into a unified top-navbar layout under `(public)`. The current three-route-group split (workspace, dashboard, control) creates redundant auth-gated shells and forces users through multiple navigation paradigms. The target is a single public-facing layout with a top navbar that adapts its items based on auth status and role.

## Categorization

### Can move to public (auth-aware rendering)

These pages already have public counterparts or can render differently based on auth status:

| Current route | Public route | Migration notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/workspace/discussions` | `/community?filter=mine` | Add "My Discussions" filter tab to existing `/community` page. When unauthenticated, hide the filter. |
| `/dashboard/rankings` | `/rankings` | Already has a public counterpart. Dashboard version adds personalized context — merge by adding auth-aware section. |
| `/dashboard/languages` | `/languages` | Already has a public counterpart. Dashboard version is identical — remove dashboard version. |
| `/dashboard/compiler` | `/playground` | Already has a public counterpart. Consider merging or cross-linking. |

### Must stay in authenticated area

These pages handle sensitive data or write operations:

| Current route | Reason | Migration notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/dashboard` | Personal dashboard with role-specific widgets | Stays in `(dashboard)` but simplify its nav integration |
| `/dashboard/problems/create` | Write operation (instructor+) | Stays gated |
| `/dashboard/problems/[id]/edit` | Write operation (instructor+) | Stays gated |
| `/dashboard/contests/create` | Write operation (instructor+) | Stays gated |
| `/dashboard/groups` | Student roster data | Stays gated |
| `/dashboard/groups/[id]` | Student grades and submissions | Stays gated |
| `/dashboard/profile` | Personal settings | Stays gated |
| `/dashboard/submissions` | User submission history | Stays gated |
| `/dashboard/admin/*` | System administration | Stays gated (admin only) |
| `/control/discussions` | Moderation tools | Stays gated |

### Can be removed entirely

| Current route | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `/workspace` | Already just a redirect to `/dashboard` |

## Proposed Top Navbar Layout

### Unauthenticated user

```
[Logo/Title] [Practice] [Playground] [Contests] [Rankings] [Community] [Languages]    [Sign In] [Sign Up]
```

### Authenticated user (student)

```
[Logo/Title] [Practice] [Playground] [Contests] [Rankings] [Community] [Languages]    [Dashboard v] [Theme] [Locale]
                                                                         └─ My Submissions

```

### Authenticated user (admin)

Same as instructor, with additional "Admin" dropdown entry that navigates to `/dashboard/admin`.

---

## Phased Migration Plan

### Phase 1 — Eliminate (workspace) route group (Low risk)

**Goal:** Remove the `(workspace)` group entirely; redirect its routes.

1. Move `/workspace/discussions` functionality into `/community` as a "My Discussions" filter tab.
2. Update `PublicHeader` nav items: rename "Workspace" action to "Dashboard" and point to `/dashboard`.
3. Remove `src/app/(workspace)/layout.tsx`, `src/app/(workspace)/workspace/page.tsx`, `src/app/(workspace)/workspace/discussions/page.tsx`.
4. Remove `WorkspaceNav` component.
5. Add redirect routes: `/workspace` -> `/dashboard`, `/workspace/discussions` -> `/community?filter=mine`.
6. Remove `workspaceShell` i18n keys (merge any unique ones into `publicShell` or `community`).
7. Update `src/middleware.ts` if it has workspace-specific redirects.

**Estimated files changed:** ~10-12

### Phase 2 — Unify navigation into PublicHeader (Medium risk)

**Status:** COMPLETE

**Goal:** Replace the dual PublicHeader/Dashboard sidebar with a single top navbar that adapts by role.

1. ~~Extend `PublicHeader` to accept optional `session` and `capabilities` props.~~ DONE
2. ~~When authenticated, add a "Dashboard" dropdown menu with role-appropriate links (Problems, Groups, Submissions, Profile, Admin).~~ DONE
3. ~~The dropdown replaces the current "Workspace" action link.~~ DONE
4. Keep `(dashboard)` route group and its `AppSidebar` for now — Phase 2 only changes the top nav on public pages.
5. ~~Add a "back to public site" link in the `(dashboard)` layout header.~~ DONE (commit 2bfcbb89)

**Phase 2 bug fixes completed:**
- ~~The `DropdownItem` type has `adminOnly` and `instructorOnly` flags that are dead code~~ DONE (commit 84580d50 — removed dead flags)
- ~~Mobile menu lacks visual grouping for authenticated navigation items~~ DONE (commit 84580d50 — added "Dashboard" heading and sign-out separator)

**Estimated files changed:** ~5-8

### Phase 3 — Dashboard layout refinement (Medium risk)

**Status:** IN PROGRESS (cycle 21 — breadcrumb hidden on mobile DONE, contests in dropdown DONE; remaining: slim down AppSidebar, evaluate control route merge)

**Goal:** Simplify the dashboard layout to complement the top navbar.

1. ~~Ensure the top navbar is visible on dashboard pages (currently it is not — dashboard has its own header).~~ DONE (commit bbf36ec2 — PublicHeader added to dashboard layout)
2. ~~Consider converting `AppSidebar` from a full sidebar to a slimmer icon rail or contextual sub-navigation within each section.~~ PARTIALLY DONE (cycle 13 — removed duplicate items from AppSidebar that are already in PublicHeader dropdown; remaining items: problems, submissions, contests, compiler, rankings, groups, problem sets, admin)
3. Move breadcrumb to top navbar area. **DONE** (commit a06bd712 — moved to sticky header above main content)
4. Evaluate whether `(control)` route group should merge into `(dashboard)/admin` or remain separate.

**Additional Phase 3 improvements identified in cycle 10 review:**
- ~~Refactor `PublicHeader.getDropdownItems()` to use capability-based filtering instead of hardcoded role checks (AGG-4)~~ DONE (commit 3a2b56d7)
- ~~Remove `tracking-tight` from site title if locale is Korean (CLAUDE.md compliance).~~ DONE (commit 79204982)

**Cycle 13 improvements:**
- ~~Fix dashboard layout i18n namespace — nav items were using common.practice which doesn't exist~~ DONE (commit 4389523c — dashboard now uses publicShell.nav namespace)
- ~~Extract shared navigation config (getPublicNavItems/getPublicNavActions)~~ DONE (commit 4389523c — both layouts use shared helper)
- ~~Remove hardcoded role fallback in getDropdownItems~~ DONE (commit cb2ec48c — capability-based filtering only)
- ~~Remove duplicate AppSidebar items already in PublicHeader dropdown~~ DONE (commit 9bba87d3 — dashboard, profile removed from sidebar)

**Cycle 14 improvements:**
- ~~Add "contests" to PublicHeader dropdown~~ DONE (already present in `getDropdownItems`)

**Cycle 15 improvements:**
- Fix `tracking-wide` on PublicHeader mobile menu dashboard label — now conditional, skipped for Korean locale (commit 1416cbce)
- Fix `handleSignOut` in AppSidebar — added try/catch to reset `isSigningOut` on failure (commit 50f84172)

**Remaining Phase 3 work:**
- Further slim down `AppSidebar` to icon-only mode or contextual sub-navigation
- ~~Consider hiding breadcrumb on mobile viewports~~ DONE (already hidden via `hidden md:block`)
- Evaluate `(control)` route group merge into `(dashboard)/admin`

**Estimated files changed:** ~15-20

### Phase 4 — Route consolidation and control group merge

**Status:** IN PROGRESS (cycle 23)

**Goal:** Merge duplicate routes (dashboard rankings -> public rankings, dashboard languages -> public languages, etc.) and merge the `(control)` route group into `(dashboard)`.

**Cycle 22 progress (rankings/languages/compiler consolidation):**
- ~~Redirect `/dashboard/rankings` to `/rankings`~~ DONE (commit 662b71ec)
- ~~Redirect `/dashboard/languages` to `/languages`~~ DONE (commit 662b71ec)
- ~~Redirect `/dashboard/compiler` to `/playground`~~ DONE (commit 662b71ec)

**Cycle 23 progress (control group merge):**
- ~~Move `/control/discussions` to `/dashboard/admin/discussions` with `community.moderate` capability check~~ DONE (commit 03dc313d)
- ~~Migrate `controlShell` i18n keys to `publicShell` and `nav` namespaces~~ DONE (commit d3e890df)
- ~~Add `/control` and `/control/discussions` redirects~~ DONE (commit 03dc313d)
- ~~Remove `(control)` route group directory, `ControlNav` component, and `controlShell` namespace~~ DONE (commit 03dc313d)
- ~~Add "Discussion Moderation" to `AppSidebar` admin section~~ DONE (commit 03dc313d)
- ~~Remove stale `publicShell.nav.workspace` i18n key~~ DONE (commit d3e890df)
- ~~Centralize dropdown items in shared nav module~~ DONE (commit 4bbc65aa)

**Remaining Phase 4 work:**
1. ~~Make public pages auth-aware: render additional sections or edit buttons when the user is authenticated and has the right capabilities.~~ DONE — "Edit Problem" button added to `/practice/problems/[id]` for users with `problems.create` capability (commit 167fa41c); "Problem Sets" added to PublicHeader dropdown for users with `problem_sets.create` capability (cycle 16)
2. Remove redundant page components under `(dashboard)` where public counterparts exist.

**Estimated files changed:** ~20-30

## Open Questions

1. **Should the admin panel keep its sidebar layout?** The admin section has 8+ sub-pages. A top navbar may not have enough room. Recommendation: keep sidebar for admin, but nest it under the unified top navbar.

2. **Mobile navigation strategy.** The current `PublicHeader` likely uses a hamburger menu on mobile. Adding authenticated dropdown items needs to be tested for mobile UX. Consider a mobile drawer.

3. **Lecture mode integration.** The dashboard layout includes `LectureModeProvider`, `LectureModeToggle`, and `LectureToolbar`. These must survive the layout migration. Recommendation: move lecture mode into the `(dashboard)` layout at the page level rather than the root layout.

4. **Chat widget.** `ChatWidgetLoader` is rendered in the dashboard layout. Must be preserved after migration. Can be moved to a root layout or rendered per-page.

5. **Breadcrumb placement.** Currently inside `(dashboard)` layout. After migration, should it be in the top navbar or remain in-page?

6. **SEO impact.** Public pages have `generateMetadata` with SEO-optimized titles. Authenticated dashboard pages use `NO_INDEX_METADATA`. This distinction must be preserved — public pages stay indexed, dashboard pages stay noindex.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Mobile UX audit of proposed top navbar with dropdowns
- [ ] Design mockup or Figma for the unified nav (authenticated + unauthenticated)
- [ ] Review of `AppSidebar` capabilities-based rendering logic to ensure nothing is lost
- [ ] i18n audit: `workspaceShell.*` keys must be migrated before removing the layout

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Breaking auth-gated page access | Medium | High | Thorough capability-based testing per role |
| Mobile nav overflow with many items | Medium | Medium | Dedicated mobile drawer design |
| Lecture mode regression | Low | High | Move lecture providers into dashboard layout before removing workspace layout |
| SEO regression on public pages | Low | High | Verify `generateMetadata` and `NO_INDEX_METADATA` still apply correctly |
| Lost i18n keys during migration | Medium | Low | Audit `workspaceShell` keys before deletion |

## Estimated Total Effort

- Phase 1: 1-2 hours
- Phase 2: 2-3 hours
- Phase 3: 3-4 hours
- Phase 4: 4-6 hours
- **Total: 10-15 hours** (spread across multiple cycles)
