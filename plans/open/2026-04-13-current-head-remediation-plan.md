## Reopen reason
The earlier 2026-04-13 acceptance note is now superseded by a newer user directive to fix the issues rather than merely accept the current posture.

## Workstream A — Role-model and custom-role correctness
**Targets**
- user create/update API routes
- user-management server actions
- admin user dialogs/pages
- contest/group page entrypoints and helpers that still assume built-in roles only

**Acceptance criteria**
- custom roles can be created, assigned, updated, and persisted through supported user-management surfaces
- page-level contest/group views no longer crash on custom-role sessions
- capability-aware paths are used where custom roles are expected

**Progress**
- ⏳ not started

## Workstream B — Chat transcript integrity and admin chat-log correctness
**Targets**
- chat widget route/client logging contract
- admin chat-log session listing query and transcript retrieval semantics
- tool-layer assignment metadata access checks

**Acceptance criteria**
- client cannot suppress or forge authoritative transcript history
- admin session index works on PostgreSQL and previews earliest message correctly
- tool outputs do not leak assignment metadata outside authorized scope

**Progress**
- ⏳ not started

## Workstream C — Realtime/runtime/deploy correctness
**Targets**
- SSE shared-slot lifecycle
- production upload persistence path
- docker-proxy permissions vs documented/admin-supported image management
- truth-sync across env examples and runtime docs

**Acceptance criteria**
- shared coordination does not leak slots on terminal-response path
- production deployment preserves uploaded files across container replacement
- admin image-management chain is either supported end-to-end or truthfully constrained
- docs/env examples match actual runtime contract

**Progress**
- ⏳ not started

## Workstream D — Similarity engine parity
**Targets**
- TS and Rust normalizers
- inline `#` comment handling
- parity/regression tests

**Acceptance criteria**
- TS fallback and Rust sidecar produce the same normalization semantics on shared fixtures
- inline `#` comment churn no longer trivially evades normalization for supported language families

**Progress**
- ⏳ not started

## Workstream E — Current-head hardening follow-through
**Targets**
- implement any concrete, code-level improvements still feasible from the current-head multi-perspective/adversarial plans while the above workstreams are touched
- keep docs/ops surfaces honest if any accepted posture remains after code changes

**Acceptance criteria**
- remaining current-head criticism is either fixed or explicitly reduced to a genuinely external prerequisite

**Progress**
- ⏳ not started

## Verification matrix
- per-slice: targeted `pnpm -s tsc --noEmit`, targeted Vitest, targeted eslint
- final: broader unit/component suites plus any relevant Rust tests and a final plan-status pass
