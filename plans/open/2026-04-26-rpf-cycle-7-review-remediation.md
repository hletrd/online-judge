# RPF Cycle 7 — Review Remediation Plan

**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Cycle:** 7/100 of review-plan-fix loop
**Source aggregate:** `.context/reviews/_aggregate.md`

## Status Legend
- `[ ]` — Not started
- `[~]` — In progress
- `[x]` — Done
- `[d]` — Deferred (with reason)

## Cycle 7 Summary

The cycle-7 multi-agent review surfaced **0 HIGH-severity** and **0 MEDIUM-severity** findings. All 3 cycle-6 plan tasks (Step 5b backfill, DRIZZLE_PUSH_FORCE documentation, cycle-5 plan archival) are confirmed RESOLVED at HEAD across all 11 review lanes. No regressions detected.

The cycle-7 findings cluster into ~50 LOW items (~28 deduplicated after cross-agent overlap), of which 3 are plannable for implementation this cycle:

1. **AGG7-1** (3-agent convergence: CRIT7-1, PERF7-1, CRIT7-2) — Add sunset criterion comment to `deploy-docker.sh` Step 5b and AGENTS.md "Sunset criteria" subsection. The cycle-6 backfill is correct but adds permanent ~5-10s overhead per deploy; without a sunset criterion, future maintainers will preserve it indefinitely.
2. **AGG7-2** (housekeeping: CRIT7-4) — Move cycle-6 plan to `plans/done/` per the README convention.
3. **AGG7-3** (3-agent convergence: DBG7-3, TE7-2, TE7-5) — Add explanatory comment above `route.ts:84` clarifying the dual nature of the `_lastRefreshFailureAt.delete` (necessary on first-set, redundant on overwrite via dispose hook).

All ~28 other deduplicated LOW findings are defensible defers, recorded in the deferred table at the end of this plan with file+line, severity, deferral reason, and exit criteria per the deferred-fix rules.

## Tasks

### Task A — [LOW, 3-agent convergence] Document sunset criterion for `deploy-docker.sh` Step 5b backfill (AGG7-1 / CRIT7-1 / PERF7-1 / CRIT7-2)

**Status:** `[ ]`
**Severity:** LOW (operational lifecycle / ops debt)
**Confidence:** HIGH
**Reference:** `.context/reviews/_aggregate.md` AGG7-1; per-agent: `critic.md` CRIT7-1, `critic.md` CRIT7-2, `perf-reviewer.md` PERF7-1

**Problem:** The cycle-6 fix introduced Step 5b in `deploy-docker.sh:570-596` — an idempotent `secret_token` backfill that runs on EVERY deploy regardless of whether the column exists. The fix is correct (the `IF EXISTS` guard makes the DO-block a no-op when the column is gone), but adds a permanent ~5-10s overhead per deploy. Without a documented sunset criterion, future maintainers will:
- Preserve the block indefinitely (operational debt).
- Or remove it without checking that all environments have applied the DROP COLUMN, regressing cycle-6.

**Plan:**

1. Add an inline comment block to `deploy-docker.sh` at the end of the Step 5b comment block (around lines 567-569), noting:
   - The SUNSET CRITERION: this Step 5b can be removed when (a) the `secret_token` column is verified ABSENT from ALL deploy environments via `psql ... -c "\d judge_workers"`, AND (b) at least 6 months have passed since this fix was deployed (cycle-6 commit `18d93273` on 2026-04-26).
   - A target re-evaluation date: 2026-10-26 (6 months out from the cycle-6 fix).
   - The check command to verify column absence.
2. Add a corresponding "Sunset criteria" subsection to `AGENTS.md` "Database migration recovery (DRIZZLE_PUSH_FORCE)" section (around line 365), describing:
   - Same sunset criterion + re-evaluation date.
   - The verification command operators can run before removing.

**Commit:** `docs(deploy): 📝 add sunset criterion for Step 5b secret_token backfill (AGG7-1)`

**Exit criteria:**
- `deploy-docker.sh` Step 5b comment block contains "SUNSET" (or equivalent) keyword + re-evaluation date.
- `AGENTS.md` "Database migration recovery" section has a "Sunset criteria" subsection.
- All gates green (lint 0 errors / 14 unchanged warnings, test:unit pass, build EXIT=0).

---

### Task B — [LOW, housekeeping] Archive cycle-6 plan to `plans/done/` (AGG7-2 / CRIT7-4)

**Status:** `[ ]`
**Severity:** LOW (process)
**Confidence:** HIGH
**Reference:** `.context/reviews/_aggregate.md` AGG7-2; per-agent: `critic.md` CRIT7-4

**Problem:** `plans/open/2026-04-26-rpf-cycle-6-review-remediation.md` exists with all tasks marked `[x]` done. Per `plans/open/README.md:36-39`: "Once **every** task in such a plan is `[x]`, the plan must be moved to `plans/done/` in the next cycle's housekeeping pass — typically by the cycle that follows it."

**Plan:**
1. Verify all tasks in `plans/open/2026-04-26-rpf-cycle-6-review-remediation.md` are `[x]` (verified at cycle start: yes — A, B, C all `[x]` with commit IDs `18d93273`, `8a776241`, `e5d1dc64`).
2. `git mv plans/open/2026-04-26-rpf-cycle-6-review-remediation.md plans/done/`.
3. Commit.

**Commit:** `docs(plans): 🗂️ archive completed cycle 6 plan to plans/done/ (AGG7-2)`

**Exit criteria:**
- Cycle-6 plan in `plans/done/`.
- `plans/open/` contains only standing/master plans + this cycle-7 plan.

---

### Task C — [LOW, 3-agent convergence] Document the dual nature of `_lastRefreshFailureAt.delete` in `route.ts:84` (AGG7-3 / DBG7-3 / TE7-2 / TE7-5)

**Status:** `[ ]`
**Severity:** LOW (maintainability — invariant invisible to readers)
**Confidence:** HIGH
**Reference:** `.context/reviews/_aggregate.md` AGG7-3; per-agent: `debugger.md` DBG7-3, `test-engineer.md` TE7-2 / TE7-5

**Problem:** `route.ts:82-84` (success path) calls:
```ts
analyticsCache.set(cacheKey, { data: fresh, createdAt: await getDbNowMs() });
_lastRefreshFailureAt.delete(cacheKey);
```

The dispose hook ALSO clears the cooldown on overwrite. So the explicit delete is:
- REDUNDANT on overwrite (dispose already cleared)
- NECESSARY on first-set (no prior entry → no dispose fires)

This dual nature is invisible. A reader scanning the code might think the explicit delete is always necessary (and not realize dispose covers the overwrite case), or always redundant (and remove it, breaking the first-set case).

**Plan:**
1. Add a one-line comment above `route.ts:84` explaining the dual nature:
   ```ts
   // Explicit delete here covers the "first set" case (no prior value, no
   // dispose fires). On overwrite, dispose has already cleared the cooldown.
   _lastRefreshFailureAt.delete(cacheKey);
   ```

**Commit:** `docs(analytics): 📝 clarify _lastRefreshFailureAt delete necessity on first-set vs overwrite (AGG7-3)`

**Exit criteria:**
- Comment present above `route.ts:84` describing the first-set vs overwrite split.
- Gates green.

## Deferred (DO NOT IMPLEMENT this cycle)

The following findings are recorded as deferred per the deferred-fix rules. Each cites file+line, original severity (preserved, NOT downgraded), deferral reason, repo-rule allowance (default = no rule forbids deferring this category), and exit criterion to re-open.

**Repo-rule check:** Per orchestrator's deferred-fix rules, "Security, correctness, and data-loss findings are NOT deferrable unless the repo's own rules explicitly allow it." All cycle-7 findings are LOW-severity. No HIGH or MEDIUM findings are present. The cluster around `secret_token` (cycle-6 AGG6-1) is confirmed FIXED at HEAD; the remaining findings are operational lifecycle / cosmetic / defensive.

### Carried-deferred from cycles 1-5 (unchanged per `_aggregate-cycle-48.md`)

All carried items remain deferrable. See `_aggregate-cycle-48.md` for the full table.

## Verification Plan

After each task commit, run the gates locally:
- `npm run lint` (must be EXIT=0; existing 14 untracked-script warnings unchanged)
- `npm run build` (must be EXIT=0)
- `npm run test:unit` (must be EXIT=0)

After all tasks complete, run the deploy per `DEPLOY_MODE: per-cycle`:
- `bash -c 'set -a; source .env.deploy.algo; set +a; ./deploy-docker.sh --skip-languages --no-worker --skip-worker-build'`

---

## Workspace-to-Public Migration Directive

Per cycle orchestrator instruction: "Make progress in this cycle ONLY where the review surfaces a relevant opportunity; do NOT force unrelated migration work."

**Status:** No workspace-to-public migration opportunity surfaced in any of the 11 review lanes this cycle. Per `user-injected/workspace-to-public-migration.md`, the migration is "substantially complete" and remains a "placeholder for opportunistic edge cases". Cycle-7 honors the surfacing rule by NOT taking migration action.

---

## Rule Compliance

- All commits will be GPG-signed (`-S` flag) per CLAUDE.md / global rules.
- Conventional commit format with gitmoji.
- No `Co-Authored-By` lines.
- No `--no-verify`, no force-push.
- Fine-grained: one commit per task.
- `git pull --rebase` before each `git push`.
