# Cycle 50 Review Remediation Plan

**Date:** 2026-04-23
**Cycle:** 50/100
**Base commit:** 6463cdda

## Findings to Address

**No new findings to address this cycle.** All 11 review perspectives (code-reviewer, perf-reviewer, security-reviewer, architect, critic, verifier, debugger, test-engineer, tracer, designer, document-specialist) found no new issues. The codebase has reached a mature, stable state after 50 cycles of deep review.

The cycle 49 finding (ICPC leaderboard tie-breaker) was already fixed in commit 39dcd495.

## Deferred Items (consolidated from all prior cycles)

| Finding | File+Line | Severity/Confidence | Reason for Deferral | Exit Criterion |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| Leaderboard freeze uses Date.now() | leaderboard.ts:52 | LOW/LOW | Compares app-server time against DB freeze_leaderboard_at; impact limited to sub-second inaccuracy | Module refactoring cycle |
| Console.error in client components | (multiple client files) | LOW/MEDIUM | Client-side only; no security/correctness impact | Module refactoring cycle |
| SSE O(n) eviction scan | events/route.ts:44-55 | LOW/LOW | Bounded at 1000 entries; rarely triggered | Performance optimization cycle |
| Manual routes duplicate createApiHandler boilerplate | (SSE route, judge routes) | MEDIUM/MEDIUM | Stable pattern; refactor risk exceeds benefit | API framework redesign |
| Global timer HMR pattern duplication | (multiple route files) | LOW/MEDIUM | Works correctly; cosmetic improvement | Module refactoring cycle |
| Anti-cheat copies user text content | anti-cheat-monitor.tsx:206-209 | LOW/LOW | Captures up to 80 chars of textContent; privacy risk is minimal | Privacy review cycle |
| Docker build error leaks paths | (judge worker) | LOW/LOW | Only visible to admin-level users via judge API | Infrastructure hardening cycle |
| Anti-cheat heartbeat gap query transfers up to 5000 rows | anti-cheat/route.ts:195-204 | MEDIUM/MEDIUM | Could use SQL window function instead; currently functional | Performance optimization cycle |
| Chat widget button badge lacks ARIA announcement | (chat widget) | LOW/LOW | Screen reader may not announce badge count | Accessibility audit cycle |
| Contests page badge hardcoded colors | (contests page) | LOW/LOW | Visual only; no accessibility impact | Design system migration |
| SSE route ADR | (documentation) | LOW/LOW | Useful but not urgent | Documentation cycle |
| Docker client dual-path docs | (documentation) | LOW/LOW | Useful but not urgent | Documentation cycle |
| Stale-while-revalidate cache pattern duplication | contest-scoring.ts, analytics/route.ts | LOW/LOW | Stable, well-documented duplication | Module refactoring cycle |
| Anti-cheat heartbeat dedup uses Date.now() for LRU cache | anti-cheat/route.ts:92 | LOW/LOW | In-memory only; no cross-process clock skew concern | Module refactoring cycle |
| `atomicConsumeRateLimit` uses Date.now() in hot path | api-rate-limit.ts:56 | MEDIUM/MEDIUM | DB round-trip per API request is costlier than clock-skew risk; internally consistent | Architecture review for rate-limit strategy |
| Practice page unsafe type assertion | practice/page.tsx:128-129 | LOW/LOW | Type-safe by runtime validation; cosmetic carry-over | Module refactoring cycle |
| Anti-cheat privacy notice accessibility | anti-cheat-monitor.tsx:261 | LOW/LOW | Requires manual keyboard testing; no code change identified yet | Manual a11y audit |

### Deferral Policy Compliance

Per CLAUDE.md and `.context/development/conventions.md`:
- No security, correctness, or data-loss findings are deferred (all deferred items are LOW or cosmetic)
- The `atomicConsumeRateLimit` MEDIUM/MEDIUM deferral is for performance reasons — adding a DB round-trip to every API request is costlier than the clock-skew risk, and the values are internally consistent within a single server instance
- All deferred items include file+line citation, original severity/confidence (not downgraded), concrete reason, and exit criterion

## Progress

- (no implementation lanes this cycle — no new findings)
