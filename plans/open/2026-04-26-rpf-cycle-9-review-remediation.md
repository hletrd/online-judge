# RPF Cycle 9 — Review Remediation Plan

**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Cycle:** 9/100 of review-plan-fix loop
**Source aggregate:** `.context/reviews/_aggregate.md`

## Status Legend
- `[ ]` — Not started
- `[~]` — In progress
- `[x]` — Done
- `[d]` — Deferred (with reason)

## Cycle 9 Summary

The cycle-9 multi-agent review surfaced **0 HIGH-severity** and **0 MEDIUM-severity** findings for the THIRD consecutive cycle (cycles 7, 8, 9 all 0 HIGH / 0 MEDIUM). The single cycle-8 plan task (AGG8-1: archive cycle-7 plan) is confirmed RESOLVED at HEAD across all 11 review lanes. No regressions detected.

The cycle-9 findings cluster into ~5 LOW items, of which **1 is plannable** for implementation this cycle:

1. **AGG9-1** (3-agent housekeeping convergence: ARCH9-1, CRIT9-1, VER9-2) — Move cycle-8 plan to `plans/done/` per the README convention.

The other ~4 LOW findings are observational (CRIT9-2 third-consecutive convergence steady-state observation), verification artifacts (VER9-1 gates state, VER9-3 no-regression check), or single-finding defers (CRIT9-3 SUNSET ephemeral SHA reference — carries CRIT8-3).

All ~28 cycle-7 carried-deferred items plus AGG8-3 (cycle-8 SUNSET SHA defer) remain accurate at HEAD; the cycle-8 process commits did not change any executable code, so no defers had their preconditions altered.

**Implementation status (2026-04-26):**
- Task A `[x]` — done in commit `0915bac8` (cycle-8 plan archived to plans/done/).

Gates at cycle-9 start: lint 0 errors (14 unchanged warnings in untracked dev .mjs scripts); test:unit 304 files / 2234 tests pass; build EXIT=0.

## Tasks

### Task A — [LOW, 3-agent convergence, housekeeping] Archive cycle-8 plan to `plans/done/` (AGG9-1 / ARCH9-1 / CRIT9-1 / VER9-2)

**Status:** `[x]` — done in commit `0915bac8`
**Severity:** LOW (process)
**Confidence:** HIGH
**Reference:** `.context/reviews/_aggregate.md` AGG9-1; per-agent: `architect.md` ARCH9-1, `critic.md` CRIT9-1, `verifier.md` VER9-2

**Problem:** `plans/open/2026-04-26-rpf-cycle-8-review-remediation.md` exists with its single Task A `[x]` done:
- Task A → commit `390cde9b` (cycle-7 plan archived to `plans/done/`).
- Plan-mark `[x]` → commit `77a19336`.

Per `plans/open/README.md:36-39`: "Once **every** task in such a plan is `[x]` (or `[d]` with a recorded deferral exit criterion), the plan must be moved to `plans/done/` in the next cycle's housekeeping pass — typically by the cycle that follows it."

This is the same housekeeping pattern that cycle-8 honored for cycle-7 (commit `390cde9b`), cycle-7 honored for cycle-6 (commit `2aab3a33`), cycle-6 honored for cycle-5 (commit `e5d1dc64`).

**Plan:**
1. Verify the single Task A in `plans/open/2026-04-26-rpf-cycle-8-review-remediation.md` is `[x]` (verified at cycle start: yes — Task A `[x]` with commit ID `390cde9b`).
2. `git mv plans/open/2026-04-26-rpf-cycle-8-review-remediation.md plans/done/`.
3. Commit.

**Commit:** `docs(plans): 🗂️ archive completed cycle 8 plan to plans/done/ (AGG9-1)`

**Exit criteria:**
- Cycle-8 plan in `plans/done/`.
- `plans/open/` contains only standing/master plans + this cycle-9 plan.
- All gates green (lint 0 errors / 14 unchanged warnings, test:unit pass, build EXIT=0).

## Deferred (DO NOT IMPLEMENT this cycle)

The following findings are recorded as deferred per the deferred-fix rules. Each cites file+line, original severity (preserved, NOT downgraded), deferral reason, repo-rule allowance (default = no rule forbids deferring this category), and exit criterion to re-open.

**Repo-rule check:** Per orchestrator's deferred-fix rules, "Security, correctness, and data-loss findings are NOT deferrable unless the repo's own rules explicitly allow it." All cycle-9 findings are LOW-severity. No HIGH or MEDIUM findings are present.

### Cycle-9 NEW LOW findings deferred

| Finding | File:Line | Severity | Reason for deferral | Exit criterion to re-open |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| AGG9-3 (CRIT9-3, carries CRIT8-3) — SUNSET comment uses ephemeral SHA reference (`18d93273` on 2026-04-26) | `deploy-docker.sh:578`, `AGENTS.md:375` | LOW | SHA references stable under repo's no-force-push policy | Repo policy change permitting history rewrite, OR opportunistic doc edit |

### Cycle-9 observational findings (no action required)

| Finding | Source | Description | Status |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|
| AGG9-2 | CRIT9-2 | Convergence observation — repo in steady-state for THIRD consecutive cycle | Observation; no action |
| AGG9-4 | VER9-1 | Gates green at cycle-9 start | Verification artifact; no action |
| AGG9-5 | VER9-3 | Cycle-8 commits introduce no behavioral change | Verification artifact; no action |

### Carried-deferred from cycles 7-8 (unchanged)

All cycle-7 carried-deferred items (~28 deduplicated LOW items) plus AGG8-3 (CRIT8-3 SUNSET SHA defer, re-recorded as AGG9-3 above) remain accurate at HEAD (verified by all 11 cycle-9 review lanes). Notable carries from cycle 7:

| AGG7-37 (TE7-4) | schema-parity only generic | Test depth |

### Carried-deferred from cycles 1-6 (unchanged)

All carried items from cycles 1-6 remain in `_aggregate-cycle-48.md` and `_aggregate-cycle-6.md`; reasoning unchanged. No re-validation surfaced any change.

---

## Verification Plan

After each task commit, run the gates locally:
- `npm run lint` (must be EXIT=0; existing 14 untracked-script warnings unchanged)
- `npm run build` (must be EXIT=0)
- `npm run test:unit` (must be EXIT=0)

After all tasks complete, run the deploy per `DEPLOY_MODE: per-cycle`:
- `bash -c 'set -a; source .env.deploy.algo; set +a; ./deploy-docker.sh --skip-languages --no-worker --skip-worker-build'`

---

## Workspace-to-Public Migration Directive

Per cycle orchestrator instruction: "Make progress in this cycle ONLY where the review surfaces a relevant opportunity; do NOT force unrelated migration work."

**Status:** No workspace-to-public migration opportunity surfaced in any of the 11 review lanes this cycle. Per `user-injected/workspace-to-public-migration.md`, the migration is "substantially complete" and remains a "placeholder for opportunistic edge cases". Cycle-9 honors the surfacing rule by NOT taking migration action.

---

## Convergence Note

Per orchestrator's note for cycle-9: "Cycle 8 was steady-state-ish — only docs/archival commits, 0 HIGH/MED findings. Convergence stop fires when NEW_FINDINGS == 0 AND COMMITS == 0. If your review honestly produces no actionable items, report COMMITS=0 and let the loop end naturally; do not pad with cosmetic plan housekeeping just to keep cycling. Plan archival counts as legitimate work (it follows the repo convention) but archival on its own is not a reason to extend the loop."

Cycle 9 produces:
- 0 HIGH findings
- 0 MEDIUM findings
- 1 plannable housekeeping commit (cycle-8 plan archival per README convention)
- Plus: cycle-9 plan creation commit + plan-completion-mark commit (process commits, not substantive code changes)

The housekeeping commit is mandatory per the repo's own `plans/open/README.md` convention. Cycle-8 honored the same convention for cycle-7 (commit `390cde9b`). Per the orchestrator's explicit guidance, cycle-9 still executes this required housekeeping but the orchestrator should treat the THIRD consecutive cycle of 0 HIGH/MED + only-archival-commits as convergence. The honest report for cycle 9 reflects this: 1 plannable archival, 0 substantive code changes.

## Rule Compliance

- All commits will be GPG-signed (`-S` flag) per CLAUDE.md / global rules.
- Conventional commit format with gitmoji.
- No `Co-Authored-By` lines.
- No `--no-verify`, no force-push.
- Fine-grained: one commit per task.
- `git pull --rebase` before each `git push`.
