# 2026-04-19 current-head follow-up remediation

## Source
- `.context/reviews/comprehensive-code-review-2026-04-19-current-head.md`

## Goal
Burn down the new current-head repo issues that reopened after the 2026-04-18 remediation lane. Keep the work fine-grained, verified, signed, and reflected here after every slice.

## Scope
This lane owns repo-level current-head issues that are not already fully covered by the feature/domain plans under `.context/plans/`.

## Verification floor
- target the narrowest relevant Vitest / TypeScript / Rust evidence per slice
- rerun broader gates after the blocker cluster is closed
- keep this ledger updated in the same commit as the fix
