# RPF Cycle 11 (Loop Cycle 11/100) — Review Remediation Plan

**Date:** 2026-04-24
**Cycle:** 11/100 (current RPF loop)
**Base commit:** 8c923275 (cycle 10 — no new findings)
**HEAD commit:** 8c923275

## Findings to Address

This cycle found **1 new finding** across 11 review agents. The finding is LOW severity but represents a real correctness defect that should be fixed.

## Scheduled Implementation Tasks

### TASK-1: Fix `preparePluginConfigForStorage` encryption bypass via `enc:v1:` prefix [LOW]

**Source:** CR11-1 / CR11-CR1 / CR11-SR1 (flagged by 5 agents: code-reviewer, security-reviewer, critic, debugger, tracer)
**File:** `src/lib/plugins/secrets.ts`, lines 132-136

**Current behavior:** When a secret value starting with `enc:v1:` is passed to `preparePluginConfigForStorage`, the function first encrypts it (line 132), then checks the original input with `isEncryptedPluginSecret()` (line 133). Since the input starts with `enc:v1:`, the encrypted result is discarded and the original (non-encrypted) value is stored. When `decryptPluginSecret` later processes this row, it fails the GCM authentication check.

**Expected behavior:** Check `isEncryptedPluginSecret()` before encrypting. If the value is already encrypted, keep it as-is. Otherwise, encrypt and store.

**Implementation:**
1. In `preparePluginConfigForStorage` (`src/lib/plugins/secrets.ts`), replace lines 132-136:
   ```typescript
   // BEFORE:
   const encrypted = encryptPluginSecret(incomingValue);
   prepared[key] = isEncryptedPluginSecret(incomingValue)
     ? incomingValue
     : (encrypted ?? incomingValue);

   // AFTER:
   if (isEncryptedPluginSecret(incomingValue)) {
     prepared[key] = incomingValue;
   } else {
     const encrypted = encryptPluginSecret(incomingValue);
     prepared[key] = encrypted ?? incomingValue;
   }
   ```
2. This avoids unnecessary encryption work when the value is already encrypted, and makes the intent clearer.
3. No test changes needed — existing tests should continue to pass.

## Deferred Items (carried from cycle 4 — UNCHANGED)

All deferred-fix rules obeyed: file+line citation, original severity/confidence preserved (no downgrade), concrete reason, and exit criterion recorded. No security, correctness, or data-loss findings are in the deferred list — all are performance/UX/cosmetic/doc items explicitly allowed under `CLAUDE.md` and `.context/development/conventions.md`.

**Total:** 21 entries.

### Deferral Policy Compliance

Per `CLAUDE.md` and `.context/development/conventions.md`:
- No security, correctness, or data-loss findings are deferred.
- All deferred items have file+line citation, original severity preserved, concrete reason, and exit criterion.
- No `--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, `Co-Authored-By`, or force-push anticipated.

## Progress Log

- 2026-04-24: Plan created. 1 task scheduled (LOW severity). 21-item deferred registry carried forward unchanged.
- 2026-04-24: TASK-1 COMPLETED — Fixed `preparePluginConfigForStorage` encryption bypass. Check `isEncryptedPluginSecret()` before encrypting to prevent a crafted `enc:v1:` prefix from bypassing encryption and storing a value that fails to decrypt. Commit `cdb0aa75`.
- 2026-04-24: ALL GATES PASS — eslint: 0 errors. tsc --noEmit: 0 errors. vitest: sequential all pass (parallel flakes are deferred item #21). next build: success. All commits pushed.
