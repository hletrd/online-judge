## Superseded review lines

### `.context/reviews/comprehensive-code-review-2026-04-07.md`
- **Status:** archived as superseded
- **Reason:** later 2026-04-09 / 2026-04-10 reviews revisit the same surfaces with fresher evidence and were themselves planned/executed.

### `.context/reviews/comprehensive-code-review-2026-04-09-worktree.md`
- **Status:** archived as implemented/superseded
- **Reason:** its concrete findings already map to completed remediation work and no fresh open plan is needed.

### `.context/reviews/comprehensive-security-review-2026-04-09.md`
- **Status:** archived as superseded
- **Reason:** the 2026-04-10 security review is the fresher authoritative security artifact and already includes closure evidence.

### `.context/reviews/_archive/*`
- **Status:** historical review context only
- **Reason:** retained for reference, not for new implementation planning.

## Open review lines after this pass
None.

The original 2026-04-12 remediation plans are closed, and the newer current-HEAD follow-up plans were archived on 2026-04-13 after explicit user acceptance of the remaining current-state limitations for now.

## Post-completion verification note
- 2026-04-12: restored the missing `db:push` package script expected by local Playwright/CI web-server flows and added `scripts/playwright-local-webserver.sh` so local Playwright starts against a fresh ephemeral PostgreSQL instance before seeding, syncing languages, building, and starting the app.

- 2026-04-12 follow-up: added an admin-side resume-code reset path for redeemed recruiting invitations so candidates who lose their resume code can be recovered without reopening invite-link replay.
- 2026-04-12 follow-up: automated pruning now also covers aged recruiting invitation records once they are terminal or long-expired.
- 2026-04-12 follow-up: automated retention now prunes terminal submissions and grading records older than 365 days while excluding in-progress queue items.

- 2026-04-13: archived the current-head follow-up plans as accepted-current-posture after the user explicitly accepted the remaining limitations around identity assurance, code-path-only load verification, browser-based anti-cheat, long retention, and worker isolation.
