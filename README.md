## Features

- **Cross-platform (AMD64 + ARM64)** — Full stack runs natively on both architectures: Next.js app, Rust judge worker, Rust sidecars, and the full supported judge-image set. Deploy on x86-64 servers or ARM64 (AWS Graviton, Ampere Altra, Apple Silicon) with automatic architecture detection — no emulation, no cross-compilation
- **120 languages** — C/C++, Java, Python, Rust, Go, Deno, Bun, Gleam, Lean 4, Hare, Koka, Chapel, Elm, Idris 2, and [106 more](docs/languages.md), all with multi-arch Docker images and admin-customizable compile/run settings
- **Scalable judging** — Distributed judge workers with automatic registration and heartbeats. Live admin dashboard. Deploy across multiple machines with a single script
- **Secure execution** — Docker containers with no network, seccomp, memory/CPU limits
- **Role-based access** — Super admin, admin, instructor, student
- **Classroom management** — Groups, enrollments, assignments with deadlines and late penalties
- **Contest system** — IOI and ICPC scoring, scheduled and windowed modes, real-time leaderboard, anti-cheat
- **Code similarity** — Rust-accelerated Jaccard n-gram analysis with TS fallback

## Getting Started

### Quickstart for Agents

Paste the following prompt into [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), [Codex](https://openai.com/index/codex/), [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), or any AI coding agent:

```text
Clone and set up JudgeKit (online judge platform) for local development.

1. git clone https://github.com/hletrd/JudgeKit.git && cd JudgeKit
2. Run `bash scripts/setup.sh` (or `bash scripts/setup.sh --defaults` for non-interactive)
3. Run `npm run dev` to start on http://localhost:3000
4. Log in with admin / admin123

Do NOT build Docker judge images — they are only needed for submission judging, not for running the web app.
```

### Manual setup

<details>
<summary>Step-by-step instructions</summary>

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # Set AUTH_SECRET (openssl rand -base64 32)
npm run db:push
npm run seed                 # Creates admin/admin123
npm run dev
```

Optionally build judge Docker images:

```bash
docker build -t judge-python -f docker/Dockerfile.judge-python .
```

See [Language presets](docs/languages.md#docker-image-presets) for preset options (`core`, `popular`, `extended`, `all`).

## Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/architecture.svg" alt="JudgeKit Architecture" width="720" />
</p>

Workers connect to the app server via HTTP(S) only. Each worker registers on startup, sends periodic heartbeats, and deregisters on graceful shutdown. The atomic `UPDATE...RETURNING` claim SQL prevents two workers from claiming the same submission. Stale workers are detected automatically and their submissions reclaimed.

The judge worker also exposes an HTTP runner endpoint (default port `3001`) for interactive "Run Code" requests plus a small internal Docker-management API used by the admin image-management screens. In the shipped Docker deployment, the Next.js app delegates all Docker work to the Rust worker instead of talking to the Docker daemon directly.

## Deployment

### Single-machine with local worker (default)

```bash
# Starts the full stack including the co-located judge worker
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml --env-file .env.production up -d

# Or via deploy script
./deploy-docker.sh
```

### App server only (remote workers)

When judge workers run on separate machines, start the full stack and then stop the local worker. Since the worker is always in the compose file, there is no flag to disable it up front:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml --env-file .env.production up -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml --env-file .env.production stop judge-worker

# Or via deploy script
./deploy-docker.sh --no-worker
```

### Dedicated workers (scale-out)

Deploy workers to separate machines using `docker-compose.worker.yml`:

```bash
JUDGE_BASE_URL=https://your-app-server/api/v1 \
JUDGE_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token \
JUDGE_CONCURRENCY=4 \
docker compose -f docker-compose.worker.yml up -d
```

Or use the deploy script:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-worker.sh --host=192.168.1.10 --app-url=https://oj.example.com/api/v1 --concurrency=4 --sync-images
```

Monitor workers at `/dashboard/admin/workers`.

> **App-instance scaling note:** judge workers can scale horizontally. The
> Next.js app now supports two realtime modes for the routes that previously
> required a single instance:
> - **process-local mode** — declare `APP_INSTANCE_COUNT=1` (or
>   `REALTIME_SINGLE_INSTANCE_ACK=1`) and keep the web tier single-instance
> - **shared PostgreSQL mode** — set `REALTIME_COORDINATION_BACKEND=postgresql`
>   so SSE connection-cap enforcement and anti-cheat heartbeat deduplication use
>   the database instead of process-local memory
>
> `redis` remains unsupported. Before claiming exam-grade or public-contest
> readiness, still validate sticky-session / load-balancer behavior and broader
> realtime scaling under the PostgreSQL-backed path.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker socket proxy**: The deployment uses a dedicated `docker-proxy` service (`tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy`) as the only container with direct `/var/run/docker.sock` access. The **judge worker only** talks to Docker through `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker-proxy:2375`; the Next.js app uses the worker’s authenticated internal API instead of direct daemon access.
- **`/judge-workspaces`**: Must exist on the host before starting the stack — used as the shared workspace volume between the judge worker and sibling judge containers.
- **`COMPILER_RUNNER_URL`**: Set to `http://judge-worker:3001` in the app container to delegate interactive code execution to the Rust runner. When a runner URL is configured, local Docker fallback is now disabled by default; set `ENABLE_COMPILER_LOCAL_FALLBACK=1` only for explicit development/debug scenarios.
- **`TRUSTED_DOCKER_REGISTRIES`**: Optional comma-separated allowlist for externally qualified image references (for example `ghcr.io/your-org/,registry.example.com/`). Unqualified local images such as `judge-python:latest` remain allowed.
- The `deploy-docker.sh` script handles setup automatically (server-side builds, architecture detection, nginx config). See [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md).

## Platform Modes

Four platform modes control what users see and can access. Switch modes from **Settings > General**.

| | Homework | Exam | Contest | Recruiting |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Use case** | Coursework, practice, low-stakes work | Proctored tests and exams | Competitive programming events | Candidate coding evaluations |
| **AI code review** | Enabled by default | Disabled by default | Disabled by default | Disabled by default |
| **Standalone compiler** | Available | Blocked | Available | Blocked |
| **Contests page** | Visible | Visible | Visible | Hidden* |
| **Rankings page** | Visible | Visible | Visible | Hidden* |
| **Groups page** | Visible | Visible | Visible | Hidden* |
| **Problem Sets page** | Visible | Visible | Visible | Hidden (all users) |
| **Dashboard** | Student dashboard | Student dashboard | Student dashboard | Candidate dashboard |
| **"Problems" label** | Problems | Problems | Problems | Challenges |
| **"Submissions" label** | Submissions | Submissions | Submissions | Attempts |

\* Hidden for non-admin/non-instructor users only.

Default: `homework`. Change in admin settings or directly in the database (`system_settings.platform_mode`).
