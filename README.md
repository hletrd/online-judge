## Features

- **Role-based access** — Super admin, admin, instructor, and student roles with granular permissions
- **Configurable site identity and timezone** — Admins can override the site title, description, and default timezone used for rendered timestamps across the application
- **Classroom management** — Groups, enrollments, and assignments with deadlines and late penalties
- **Instructor assignment oversight** — Group-scoped assignment status boards with scoped drill-down into assignment-linked student submissions
- **Problem management** — Sanitized descriptions, configurable time/memory limits, public/private/hidden visibility, and test-case editing before submissions exist
- **Admin login history** — Credential login outcomes with safe filtering and pagination for admin-only review
- **Secure code execution** — Docker containers with no network, seccomp profiles, memory/CPU limits, and non-root users
- **Multi-language support** — C, C++, Java, Kotlin, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, Go, and Swift with admin-customizable compile options
- **Submission workflow** — JSON submission flow, live status polling, per-test-case results, paginated submission history, draft recovery, and mixed legacy/hex submission ID support

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set AUTH_SECRET (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)

# Push database schema
npm run db:push

# Seed default admin user
npm run seed

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the application.

### Default Admin Account

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Username | `admin` |
| Email | `admin@example.com` |
| Password | `admin123` |
| Role | `super_admin` |

> **Note:** The seeded admin is forced through `/change-password` on first login. Change the default password immediately in production. On long-lived shared hosts like `oj.auraedu.me`, do not assume `admin123` is still valid unless the instance was freshly reset and reseeded.

### Local Production Run

```bash
npm run build
PORT=3000 npm run start
```

If port `3000` is already occupied, stop the stale process before restarting the production server on the same port.

## Authentication Notes

- Credentials sign-in accepts either username or email, but the seeded admin uses username `admin` by default.
- Protected-route login preserves `callbackUrl`, so logging in from a deep link should return the user to the original destination unless the forced password-change flow overrides it.
- Next.js 16 route protection now lives in `src/proxy.ts`, not `src/middleware.ts`.
- HTTPS deployments that terminate TLS at a reverse proxy must preserve the original scheme. Auth.js JWT readers in `src/proxy.ts` and `src/lib/api/auth.ts` rely on `src/lib/auth/secure-cookie.ts` to choose the correct secure cookie name.
- Normal protected `/api/v1/*` routes use the Auth.js credentials login plus the session cookie that carries the JWT-backed session rather than a standalone bearer token; the separate bearer token is reserved for `GET`/`POST /api/v1/judge/poll`.

## Remote API Smoke Test

For browser-driven or same-origin automation, the existing Auth.js session is reused automatically. For external scripts, log in through the credentials callback first and persist the session cookie in a cookie jar before calling protected user-facing `/api/v1/*` routes. The example below is read-only and safe to rerun; instructor/admin-only writes such as `POST /api/v1/problems` use the same cookie-jar flow but mutate remote state.

```bash
export OJ_BASE_URL="https://oj.auraedu.me"
export OJ_USERNAME="instructor"
export OJ_PASSWORD="your-password"

COOKIE_JAR="$(mktemp)"
CSRF_TOKEN="$(curl -s -c "$COOKIE_JAR" "$OJ_BASE_URL/api/auth/csrf" | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["csrfToken"])')"

curl -s -b "$COOKIE_JAR" -c "$COOKIE_JAR" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  --data-urlencode "csrfToken=$CSRF_TOKEN" \
  --data-urlencode "username=$OJ_USERNAME" \
  --data-urlencode "password=$OJ_PASSWORD" \
  --data-urlencode "callbackUrl=$OJ_BASE_URL/dashboard" \
  "$OJ_BASE_URL/api/auth/callback/credentials" \
  >/dev/null

curl -s -b "$COOKIE_JAR" \
  "$OJ_BASE_URL/api/v1/problems?limit=5" \
  | python3 -c 'import json,sys; payload=json.load(sys.stdin); print(json.dumps({"total": payload.get("total"), "titles": [item.get("title") for item in payload.get("data", [])]}, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2))'

rm -f "$COOKIE_JAR"
```

The deployment dataset includes six instructor-owned private smoke-test problems with Korean titles and descriptions so you can verify the API against non-English content as well.

## System Settings

- Admins and super admins can manage site-wide title, description, and default timezone overrides from `/dashboard/admin/settings`.
- Settings are stored in the SQLite `system_settings` table and resolved through `src/lib/system-settings.ts`.
- The configured title and description flow into root metadata, the login card title, the dashboard header title, and the sidebar brand label.
- The configured timezone is used when rendering timestamps in student/admin submission views, admin user pages, and group assignment schedules.
- Leaving any field blank falls back to defaults, with localized app strings for title/description and `Asia/Seoul` as the default timezone.

## Deployment and Database Reset

- Before touching production, verify that public DNS for `oj.auraedu.me` still targets `140.238.0.181`.
- As of 2026-03-09, the demo host runs the web app via `online-judge.service` and the judge worker via `online-judge-worker.service` from `/home/ubuntu/online-judge`.
- As of 2026-03-09, `/api/health` is the lightweight readiness endpoint for automated checks after future deploys, and the production host is aligned on `oj.auraedu.me` across nginx, TLS, and `AUTH_URL`.
- As of 2026-03-07, the demo host also contains six instructor-owned private smoke-test problems created through the API: `두 수의 합 (A+B)`, `두 수의 차 (A-B)`, `두 수의 곱 (A*B)`, `세 수의 합`, `두 수 중 큰 수`, and `절댓값 구하기`.
- Do not assume the long-lived demo host still uses the seeded `admin` / `admin123` credentials unless it was reset and reseeded immediately beforehand.
- To reset the SQLite database for a disposable or demo environment, stop the app first, remove `data/judge.db`, `data/judge.db-shm`, and `data/judge.db-wal`, then run:

```bash
npm run db:push
npm run seed
```

- Re-verify login after a reset with username `admin` and password `admin123`; the expected first destination is `/change-password`.

## Comprehensive Deployment Guide

### 1. Host prerequisites

- Ubuntu host with Docker Engine, Node.js 24, npm, and systemd
- Repo checked out at `/home/ubuntu/online-judge`
- `key.pem` available locally for SSH access
- Ports `80` and `443` terminated by nginx; app stays on port `3000`

### 2. Environment configuration

Start from `.env.example` and set at least:

```bash
AUTH_SECRET=<openssl rand -base64 32>
AUTH_URL=https://oj.auraedu.me
AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true
JUDGE_AUTH_TOKEN=<openssl rand -hex 32>
JUDGE_POLL_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/v1/judge/poll
POLL_INTERVAL=2000
JUDGE_DISABLE_CUSTOM_SECCOMP=0
```

- Keep `JUDGE_POLL_URL` on the internal host URL unless the worker runs on another machine
- Set `JUDGE_DISABLE_CUSTOM_SECCOMP=1` on hosts where Docker 28+/modern kernels reject the repository seccomp profile during container init; local main now uses Docker's default seccomp for compilation, applies the repository seccomp profile only during run-phase execution when enabled, and fails closed if that run-phase profile cannot be applied

### 3. Initial provisioning

```bash
npm install
npm run db:push
npm run seed
npm run languages:sync
docker build -t judge-cpp -f docker/Dockerfile.judge-cpp .
docker build -t judge-python -f docker/Dockerfile.judge-python .
docker build -t judge-node -f docker/Dockerfile.judge-node .
docker build -t judge-rust -f docker/Dockerfile.judge-rust .
docker build -t judge-go -f docker/Dockerfile.judge-go .
docker build -t judge-swift -f docker/Dockerfile.judge-swift .
docker build -t judge-jvm -f docker/Dockerfile.judge-jvm .
npm run build
```

### 4. Install systemd services

Both the web app service and the judge-worker unit are versioned in the repo.

```bash
sudo ./scripts/install-online-judge-service.sh
sudo ./scripts/install-online-judge-worker-service.sh
```

The web app unit lives at `scripts/online-judge.service`, and the worker unit lives at `scripts/online-judge-worker.service`. Both expect the repo at `/home/ubuntu/online-judge` with `.env` in the same directory.

### 4a. Install nginx and TLS config

Bootstrap the hostname with the HTTP-only vhost first, issue the certificate, then switch to the final HTTPS config:

```bash
sudo install -m 0644 scripts/online-judge.nginx-http.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/online-judge
sudo ln -sfn /etc/nginx/sites-available/online-judge /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/online-judge
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
sudo certbot certonly --nginx -d oj.auraedu.me --non-interactive
sudo install -m 0644 scripts/online-judge.nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/online-judge
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

The final checked-in HTTPS config serves `oj.auraedu.me` only and rejects requests for unknown or retired hostnames.

### 5. Deploy updates

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
npm install
npm run db:push
npm run languages:sync
npm run build
sudo systemctl restart online-judge.service
sudo systemctl restart online-judge-worker.service
```

If you changed the judge Dockerfiles or compiler/runtime assumptions, run `npm run languages:sync`, rebuild the affected images, and then restart the worker.
If you changed versioned systemd unit files or drop-ins, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` before restarting services.

### 5a. Optional CI and backup tooling

- GitHub Actions CI now runs lint, production build, backup/restore verification, and the Playwright suite on pushes, pull requests, and manual dispatch via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- SQLite backup tooling now lives in `scripts/backup-db.sh` and `scripts/verify-db-backup.sh`.
- Repo-managed backup timer artifacts live in `scripts/online-judge-backup.service`, `scripts/online-judge-backup.timer`, and `scripts/install-online-judge-backup-timer.sh`.

### 6. Post-deploy verification

```bash
systemctl is-active online-judge.service
systemctl is-active online-judge-worker.service
curl -I http://127.0.0.1:3000/login
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/health
journalctl -u nginx -n 50 --no-pager
journalctl -u certbot.timer -n 20 --no-pager
journalctl -u online-judge-worker.service -n 50 --no-pager
```

- Confirm submissions progress out of `pending`
- Confirm `/api/health` returns `{"status":"ok"...}` with `checks.database` set to `ok`
- Confirm `https://oj.auraedu.me/login` completes TLS validation and serves the app
- Confirm retired `oj-demo.atik.kr` no longer serves the app (for example, HTTP is dropped and HTTPS returns `421` with the new-domain certificate)
- If you see `401 Unauthorized` in worker logs, verify `JUDGE_AUTH_TOKEN`
- If `oj.auraedu.me` shows a certificate mismatch, reissue the certificate for `oj.auraedu.me` and reload nginx before treating the cutover as complete
- If you see the `fsmount:fscontext:proc` container-init error, either restore/fix the repository seccomp profile or explicitly set `JUDGE_DISABLE_CUSTOM_SECCOMP=1` before restarting `online-judge-worker.service`; the worker no longer retries under Docker's default seccomp when the custom run-phase profile is expected
- For system settings schema or timezone changes, verify `/dashboard/admin/settings` and at least one timestamped page such as `/dashboard/submissions` or `/dashboard/admin/users/[id]` after deploy
