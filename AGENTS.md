## Adding a New Language

1. Add to `Language` union in `src/types/index.ts`
2. Add config in `src/lib/judge/languages.ts` (toolchain version, Docker image info, compile/run commands)
3. Add Rust enum variant in `judge-worker-rs/src/types.rs`
4. Add Rust config + match arm + test entry in `judge-worker-rs/src/languages.rs`
5. Create `docker/Dockerfile.judge-<name>`
6. Add A+B test solution in `tests/e2e/all-languages-judge.spec.ts`
7. Run `npm run languages:sync` to sync to database

After syncing, the judge worker reads `dockerImage`, `compileCommand`, and `runCommand` from the database at runtime — not from compiled-in defaults. Language settings can be overridden via the admin UI at `/dashboard/admin/languages` without redeploying the worker.

## Admin Language Management

`/dashboard/admin/languages` lets admins view and override per-language settings stored in the DB:
- Docker image name (`dockerImage`)
- Compile command (`compileCommand`)
- Run command (`runCommand`)
- Toggle languages enabled/disabled
- **Disk usage** — a progress bar shows total Docker disk usage on the host with color coding (green/yellow/red). Displayed at the top of the page, fetched live via the Docker images API.
- **Per-image sizes** — each language row shows the local image size fetched live from `GET /api/v1/admin/docker/images`. Rows where the image is not yet pulled show "Not built".

Changes take effect immediately for new submissions without restarting services.

## Docker Image Management API

- `GET /api/v1/admin/docker/images` — returns the list of locally available Docker images on the judge host, including per-image size in bytes. Used by the language management UI to show image availability status and sizes.
- `POST /api/v1/admin/docker/images/build` — builds a Docker image from its Dockerfile in `docker/`. Body: `{ language: string }`. Looks up the language config to derive the Dockerfile path. Admin/super_admin only. Audit logged.
- `DELETE /api/v1/admin/docker/images` — removes a Docker image by tag. Body: `{ imageTag: string }`. Admin/super_admin only. Audit logged.

The language admin UI at `/dashboard/admin/languages` includes per-language Build (hammer icon) and Remove (trash icon) buttons. Image availability is shown as a badge ("Available" / "Not built") per row, with live image size fetched from the API.

**CSRF**: Mutation API routes require the `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header. This is the correct header name — do not use `x-csrf-token`. The admin language management UI and E2E fetch helpers must include this header on POST/DELETE/PATCH requests.

## Student Detail Page

`/dashboard/contests/[assignmentId]/students/[userId]` — accessible to admins and instructors. Shows a per-student submission breakdown for a specific assignment, with per-problem status and submission history drill-down.

## Contest System

JudgeKit supports full contest management with two scoring models and two scheduling modes:

### Scoring Models
- **IOI** (`ioi`) — partial scoring; each problem scored independently, best score per problem counts
- **ICPC** (`icpc`) — binary scoring; problems are either accepted or not, ties broken by penalty time

### Scheduling Modes
- **Scheduled** (`scheduled`) — fixed start and end times set by the admin
- **Windowed** (`windowed`) — each participant gets a fixed-duration window starting from when they begin

### Contest Features
- **Leaderboard** with real-time rankings and optional freeze period before contest end
- **Anti-cheat** — event recording (tab switches, copy/paste, focus loss), filtering, code similarity detection
- **Participant audit** — per-participant timeline of anti-cheat events, accessible to admins/instructors
- **Contest analytics** — score distribution stats (mean, median, submitted count, perfect-score count)

## Architecture

### Database
- **SQLite** at `/app/data/judge.db` (inside Docker: volume-mounted)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with schema in `src/lib/db/schema.ts`
- **Migrations**: Drizzle-generated SQL files in `drizzle/`, applied via Node script during Docker deployment (reads `.sql` files, splits on `--> statement-breakpoint`, executes each statement)
- **Sync**: `npm run languages:sync` syncs language definitions from TypeScript config to the `language_configs` table

### Security Sandbox
- **Seccomp profile**: Uses a **deny-list** approach — default action is `SCMP_ACT_ALLOW`, with specific dangerous syscalls explicitly blocked. This is more permissive during container init (avoids Docker 28+/modern-kernel init errors) while still restricting the attack surface during code execution.
- **Docker isolation**: No network access, memory/CPU limits, non-root user, resource timeouts
- **`JUDGE_DISABLE_CUSTOM_SECCOMP=1`**: Env var to fall back to Docker default seccomp on hosts where the custom profile is rejected

### Docker Deployment Architecture
- **Server-side builds**: `deploy-docker.sh` rsyncs source to the remote server and builds Docker images there. No local image builds — avoids architecture mismatches between dev machines (e.g., arm64 Mac) and the target host (e.g., amd64 Linux).
- **`--no-cache` on app and worker builds**: `deploy-docker.sh` passes `--no-cache` when building `judgekit-app` and `judgekit-judge-worker` to ensure a clean build on every deploy. Language images are not rebuilt with `--no-cache` by default.
- **DNS in Dockerfiles**: Languages that need network access during build (e.g., `cargo install`) set DNS explicitly in their Dockerfiles via `resolv.conf` override. The `--dns` flag is not used because it is incompatible with Docker BuildKit/buildx.
- **Architecture auto-detection**: The deploy script runs `uname -m` on the remote host and sets `--platform linux/amd64` or `--platform linux/arm64` accordingly. All `docker build` commands (app, judge worker, and all language images) receive this flag.
- **Docker CLI in the app container**: The `judgekit-app` image installs `docker-cli` (Alpine package) and the `nextjs` user is added to the `docker` group (gid 987) so it can reach the socket. The compose file mounts `/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` on both the `app` and `judge-worker` containers. This enables the admin Docker image management API (`GET/POST/DELETE /api/v1/admin/docker/images`) to operate without a separate privileged sidecar.
- **`privileged: true`** on the judge-worker container — required for Docker-in-Docker execution (the worker spawns sibling containers to run student code).
- **`/judge-workspaces` volume mount** — `/judge-workspaces:/judge-workspaces` is mounted on the worker container. The `TMPDIR=/judge-workspaces` env var ensures the worker writes temporary files to this shared volume. The host must have `/judge-workspaces` created before starting the stack.
- **Compiled output path**: All compiled language Dockerfiles output binaries to `/workspace/solution` (not `/tmp/solution`). `/tmp` is an ephemeral per-container tmpfs; `/workspace` is the shared workspace bind-mounted between the worker and sibling judge containers.
- **Groovy uses Java 21**: The `judge-groovy` image is based on `eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-jammy`. Groovy 4.0 requires Java 21 — Java 25 class file versions are incompatible with the Groovy bytecode verifier.
- **PID limits**: Judge containers use `--pids-limit 64` for run phase and `--pids-limit 128` for compile phase (increased from 16/64) — required for VM-based runtimes (BEAM, JVM, PowerShell) that spawn many OS threads.
- **DNS**: Judge containers use Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1). `/etc/resolv.conf` is locked with `chattr +i` to prevent container overrides.
- **Claim endpoint sh -c wrapping**: The judge claim API endpoint wraps `compileCommand` and `runCommand` values in `["sh", "-c", cmd]` before passing to the worker. The DB stores raw commands without `sh -c` — do not double-wrap when editing via admin UI.
- **Zig compile flag**: Zig 0.13 uses `-femit-bin=/workspace/solution` (not `-o`) to specify the output binary path. Example: `zig build-exe --cache-dir /tmp/zig-cache -femit-bin=/workspace/solution /workspace/solution.zig`.

### ARM64-Only Issues (4 images)

These images fail to build on arm64 and are amd64-only:
- **powershell**: Microsoft doesn't publish arm64 Debian packages
- **apl**: GNU APL build from source fails (autotools + DNS issues)
- **b**: BCause compiler uses Clang-specific flags incompatible with arm64 GCC
- **simula**: GNU Cim 5.1 doesn't compile with modern GCC on arm64

### Known Flaky Languages (E2E)

Languages in KNOWN_FLAKY are skipped in E2E tests:
- **umjunsik**: Korean esoteric lang — compiler compiles to Lamina IR, syntax unclear
- **flix**: No A+B solution yet (complex functional JVM language)
- **gleam**: Project template setup needed for compilation
- **simula**: Docker image won't build (GNU Cim)

Test cases use only positive single-digit sums (<=9) to maximize esoteric language compatibility.

## Setup

### `scripts/setup.sh` — Interactive Setup Wizard

Run `bash scripts/setup.sh` for guided initial setup. The wizard handles:
1. Admin credential configuration (`ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars, defaults: `admin` / `admin123`)
2. Language preset selection (`core`, `popular`, `extended`, `all`, `none`)
3. Individual language add/remove
4. `npm install`, `db:push`, seed, `languages:sync`, and Docker image builds

Non-interactive mode: `bash scripts/setup.sh --defaults` (uses admin/admin123, no Docker images).

The seed script (`scripts/seed.ts`) reads `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from environment variables. If not set, defaults to `admin` / `admin123`. Credentials are written to `data/.admin-password` for reference.

## Deployment

### `deploy-docker.sh` Workflow (Primary)

The recommended deployment method. Workflow:

1. **Pre-flight**: Tests SSH, verifies remote Docker, detects remote architecture
2. **Generate `.env.production`**: Creates with fresh secrets if not present
3. **rsync source to remote**: Syncs entire repo excluding `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `.git/`, `data/`, `.env*`, `*.db`, `judge-worker-rs/target/`, `rate-limiter-rs/target/`, `.omc/`, `.claude/`, `tests/`, `.playwright/`, `backups/`, `._*`
4. **Build images on remote**: Builds `judgekit-app` and `judgekit-judge-worker` with `--platform` flag, then builds judge language images
5. **Stop old containers, start new**: Uses `docker-compose.production.yml`
6. **Run database migrations**: Executes Drizzle SQL migrations inside the app container via a Node one-liner
7. **Configure nginx**: Writes config to `/tmp`, transfers via `scp`, then `sudo cp` into `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` (avoids heredoc + sudo + tee issues)
8. **Verify**: Checks HTTP response from the app container

Usage:
```bash
# Full deployment (password auth)
SSH_PASSWORD='...' REMOTE_HOST=10.50.1.116 REMOTE_USER=platform ./deploy-docker.sh

# Full deployment (key auth)
SSH_KEY=key.pem REMOTE_HOST=... REMOTE_USER=... DOMAIN=... ./deploy-docker.sh

# Skip image build (reuse existing)
./deploy-docker.sh --skip-build

# Skip judge language images only
./deploy-docker.sh --skip-languages

# Build only core language images (cpp, python, jvm)
./deploy-docker.sh --languages=core

# Build specific languages
./deploy-docker.sh --languages=cpp,python,node,rust
```

Language presets: `core` (~0.8 GB), `popular` (~2.5 GB), `extended` (~8 GB), `all` (~14 GB), `none`.

### SSH Authentication

The script supports two methods:
- **Password auth**: Set `SSH_PASSWORD` env var (requires `sshpass` installed locally)
- **Key auth**: Set `SSH_KEY` to the path of the private key file

### nginx Configuration

The deploy script writes the nginx config to a local temp file, transfers it to the remote host via `scp`, then uses `sudo cp` to install it. This avoids the common pitfall of heredoc + sudo + tee over SSH. The config includes rate limiting for auth and judge endpoints.

### `deploy.sh` (Legacy Systemd Deploy)

For hosts running services directly via systemd (not Docker). Pulls latest code, runs `npm ci`, `npm run languages:sync`, `npm run db:push`, `npm run build`, optionally builds the Rust worker with `cargo build --release`, then restarts systemd services.

## Build & Verify

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit                              # TypeScript check
npx vitest run                                # Unit tests
npx vitest run --config vitest.config.integration.ts  # Integration tests
cd judge-worker-rs && cargo test              # Rust tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/               # E2E tests (needs PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL)
```

## Testing Rules (MANDATORY)

Every feature, fix, or enhancement MUST include appropriate tests. **No code is considered complete without tests.** Work that lacks tests will be rejected.

### Test Layers (ALL required per feature)

Every new feature MUST have tests across all applicable layers:

| Layer | Tool | Location | Purpose | Required? |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Unit** | Vitest | `tests/unit/` | Pure functions, validators, utilities, scoring logic, data helpers | Always |
| **API / Mock** | Vitest | `tests/unit/api/` | Route handlers with mocked DB/auth, mock external deps | When API routes are added/changed |
| **Integration** | Vitest | `tests/integration/` | Cross-module interactions, real DB queries | When DB logic is complex |
| **E2E** | Playwright | `tests/e2e/` | Full user flows through the browser UI | Always for user-facing features |

### Per-Feature Test Checklist

For every feature, go through this checklist:

1. **Unit tests** — Test all pure logic (helpers, validators, scoring, data transforms) with known inputs/outputs. Mock DB and external dependencies. Cover both success and error paths.
2. **API / Mock tests** — Test route handlers with mocked auth and DB. Verify request validation, authorization checks, happy path responses, and error responses (401, 403, 404, 422).
3. **E2E tests** — Test the full user flow in a real browser. Navigate to the feature, interact with it, verify all sections render, verify navigation works. Test with both Korean and English locales where applicable.

### What to Test

- **New feature**: Unit tests for logic + API/mock tests for routes + E2E test for user flow (ALL three)
- **Bug fix**: Regression test that fails without the fix, passes with it
- **Refactor**: Existing tests must still pass; add tests if coverage gaps found
- **New language**: A+B solution in `tests/e2e/all-languages-judge.spec.ts` + Rust config test
- **New API route**: API test with auth/validation/happy-path/error cases + unit test for any helper functions
- **Validators**: Unit tests for valid/invalid inputs and edge cases
- **Scoring/contest logic**: Unit tests with known inputs and expected outputs
- **UI components**: E2E tests verifying rendering, interaction, and navigation

### Test Conventions

- Use factories from `tests/unit/support/factories.ts` for test data
- Mock external dependencies (DB, auth) in unit/API tests using `vi.mock()`
- E2E tests run against the test server (see `ENV.md` for target), never production
- Name test files as `<module>.test.ts` (unit/API) or `<feature>.spec.ts` (E2E)
- Group related assertions in `describe` blocks
- Test both success and error paths
- Use `test.skip()` with clear reason for tests that depend on external state (e.g., "No contests available")

### E2E Testing Rules (MANDATORY)

**Target:** Always run E2E tests against the test server (see `ENV.md` for host and credentials). Never against production.

```bash
# Standard E2E run (read ENV.md for host, credentials)
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=<from ENV.md> E2E_USERNAME=<from ENV.md> E2E_PASSWORD='<from ENV.md>' \
  npx playwright test tests/e2e/
```

**What to E2E test:**
- All user-facing features (contest, assignments, submissions, admin pages)
- All user roles (admin, instructor, student) with proper capabilities
- Contest modes: scheduled (start/end time) and windowed (fixed duration)
- All supported judge languages (`tests/e2e/all-languages-judge.spec.ts`)
- Participant audit: navigation, all sections render, back link
- Admin console: roles, users, settings, audit logs, languages (`/dashboard/admin/languages`)
- Student detail: per-student submission breakdown per assignment (`/dashboard/contests/[assignmentId]/students/[userId]`)
- Anti-cheat: event recording, filtering, similarity checks

**After every deploy:** Run full E2E suite against the test server to verify the deployment is healthy.

### Quality Gates (ALL must pass before deploy)

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero type errors
- `npx vitest run` — all unit tests pass
- `cargo test` (in judge-worker-rs/) — all Rust tests pass
- E2E tests pass against test server after deploy

## Environment Variables (`ENV.md`)

All deployment credentials, SSH access, target hosts, and runtime secrets are documented in **`ENV.md`** (gitignored, never committed). Before any deployment, SSH, or E2E testing task, **always read `ENV.md` first** to get the correct values.

`ENV.md` contains:
- **Deployment targets** — host IPs, domains, SSH users/passwords/keys, remote directories, app ports
- **Web admin credentials** — username/password for each environment
- **E2E test credentials** — `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`, `E2E_USERNAME`, `E2E_PASSWORD`
- **SSH access commands** — ready-to-use `sshpass`/`ssh` commands for each target
- **Docker & Nginx** — container management commands, nginx config paths

**CRITICAL**: Always read `ENV.md` for deployment targets, SSH credentials (hosts, users, passwords, keys), web admin logins, E2E test credentials, and remote directory paths. Never hardcode credentials in code or agent instructions. `ENV.md` contains ready-to-use SSH commands, Docker Compose commands, and E2E test invocations for each target environment.

## Deployment

**RULE: Always read `ENV.md` before any deployment, SSH, or E2E testing task.** Never guess credentials or host addresses — they are all documented in `ENV.md`. Failing to read it first leads to failed deploys and wasted time.

The primary deploy script is `deploy-docker.sh`. Pass environment variables from `ENV.md`:
- `SSH_PASSWORD` — for password-based SSH auth (Target 1)
- `SSH_KEY` — for key-based SSH auth (Target 2)
- `REMOTE_HOST`, `REMOTE_USER`, `DOMAIN` — target overrides

**Server-side builds:** `deploy-docker.sh` builds all Docker images directly on the remote server (not locally), avoiding architecture mismatches between dev machines and the target host. The script auto-detects the server's architecture (`amd64`/`arm64`) and sets the appropriate platform flag automatically.

**Docker Compose configuration (production):**
- The judge worker container runs with `privileged: true` to allow Docker-in-Docker execution
- `/judge-workspaces:/judge-workspaces` volume is mounted on the worker container for workspace sharing; `TMPDIR=/judge-workspaces` ensures the worker writes temp files there
- The host **must** have `/judge-workspaces` directory created before starting the stack

**Seccomp profile:** Uses a deny-list approach — default action is `SCMP_ACT_ALLOW`, with specific dangerous syscalls explicitly blocked. This is more permissive during container init (avoids Docker 28+/modern-kernel init errors) while still restricting the attack surface during code execution.

Always test against the test server documented in `ENV.md`, never against production. Read `ENV.md` for all target hosts and domains.

## Conventions

- Semantic commits: `<type>(<scope>): <gitmoji> <description>`
- GPG-signed commits with gitminer (7 leading zeros)
- Fine-grained commits (one per feature/fix)
- Always `git pull --rebase` before `git push`
- Every commit MUST include relevant tests (see Testing Rules above)
