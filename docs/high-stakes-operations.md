# High-stakes operations guide

_Last updated: 2026-04-12_

This guide explains the current operational truth for recruiting assessments, exams, and serious contests.

## Current position
- Homework / low-stakes coursework: supported
- Internal recruiting pilot: supported only with current restrictions and privacy safeguards
- Formal exams: not yet launch-ready
- Public or reputationally important contests: not yet launch-ready

## Reasons for continued caution
1. Recruiting identity and candidate privacy need stronger enforcement than a generic classroom flow.
2. Anti-cheat telemetry is useful, but it is not equivalent to proctoring.
3. Realtime contest/exam coordination still assumes a single web app instance unless stronger shared coordination is implemented and verified.
4. The judge worker remains a privileged trust boundary and must be operated as such.

## Required operator checks before any high-stakes pilot
- Confirm the intended platform mode and the effective restrictions it activates.
- Confirm candidate/instructor/admin privacy expectations and retention policy are communicated.
- Confirm the deployment matches the documented realtime constraints.
- Confirm the judge-worker tier is monitored as privileged infrastructure.
- Confirm the latest go/no-go and release-readiness docs still match the deployed branch.

## Judge worker trust boundary
The judge worker can start sibling judge containers through the Docker proxy path. Treat it as privileged infrastructure:
- restrict who can deploy or reconfigure it
- monitor it separately from the normal app tier
- keep incident guidance specific to worker compromise or abnormal behavior

## Anti-cheat truth
Use anti-cheat signals as review aids only. They should support human review, not replace it, and should not be presented as standalone proof of misconduct.

## Recruiting truth
Do not expose shared standings or peer-identifying ranking data to recruiting candidates. Recruiting flows should prioritize identity assurance, privacy, and self-scoped progress only.
