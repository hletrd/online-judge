# Data Retention Policy

_Last updated: 2026-04-14_

Governance reference for operators deploying JudgeKit. All implementation lives in `src/lib/data-retention.ts` and `src/lib/data-retention-maintenance.ts`.

---

## Default retention windows

| Data class | Default | Environment variable override |
|---|---|---|
| Audit events | 90 days | `AUDIT_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS` |
| AI chat messages | 30 days | `CHAT_MESSAGE_RETENTION_DAYS` |
| Anti-cheat events | 180 days | `ANTI_CHEAT_RETENTION_DAYS` |
| Recruiting invitation records | 365 days | `RECRUITING_RECORD_RETENTION_DAYS` |
| Submissions and grading records | 365 days | `SUBMISSION_RETENTION_DAYS` |

All overrides must be positive integers. Invalid or zero values are silently ignored and the default is used.

Automatic pruning runs once every 24 hours at runtime startup. In-progress submissions (`pending`, `queued`, `judging`) are excluded from automatic deletion regardless of age.

---

## Legal hold

Set `DATA_RETENTION_LEGAL_HOLD=true` (or `=1`) to suspend all automatic pruning across every data class.

When the hold is active, the runtime logs:

```
Data retention legal hold is active — skipping all automatic pruning
```

No data is deleted until the variable is removed and the application is restarted. Activate before any litigation, regulatory investigation, or audit that requires data preservation.

---

## Export modes

The export endpoint (`POST /api/v1/admin/migrate/export`) supports two modes:

**Sanitized** (default) — passwords, tokens, and keys are redacted. Use for data sharing, migration testing, or handing off a snapshot to a third party. This is the default when `?full` is omitted.

**Full-fidelity** (`?full=true`) — all fields included. Use only for disaster-recovery backups. Treat the output as a secret; store with encryption and access controls equivalent to the live database.

The backup route (`POST /api/v1/admin/backup`) always produces a full-fidelity copy. Every export is recorded in the audit log with an entry noting whether the export was sanitized or full-fidelity.

---

## Operator responsibilities

1. Review all retention windows before deployment. Confirm they satisfy your legal, academic, or contractual obligations.
2. Activate `DATA_RETENTION_LEGAL_HOLD=true` immediately when a hold is required. Lift it only after receiving written clearance.
3. Use sanitized exports for any sharing outside the production environment.
4. Store full-fidelity backups with the same access controls as the live database.
5. Re-verify this policy before launching public contests, exams, or recruiting campaigns.
